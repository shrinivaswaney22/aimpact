Follow these steps to set up AImpact locally for development or testing.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- A valid API key for the AI model (e.g., OpenAI, Grok, or similar) if applicable
- **MongoDB** or another database (optional, depending on backend setup)

### Notes:
- **Customization**: Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and update placeholders like `support@aimpact.com` or Twitter handles to match your project's details.
- **Assumptions**: The README assumes a typical web app structure with a Node.js frontend and Python backend. If your tech stack differs (e.g., React, Django, or no backend), let me know, and I can adjust the instructions.
- **Scalability**: The README is designed to be scalable. You can add sections like "API Documentation," "Deployment," or "Roadmap" as the project grows.
- **Professional Tone**: The tone is professional yet approachable, suitable for a career-focused AI tool.

If you want to tweak specific sections (e.g., add a tech stack table, include a demo link, or adjust for a different framework), let me know!
